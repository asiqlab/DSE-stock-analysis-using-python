Title: Stock Data Analysis using Python

Description:
In this project, I analyzed the stock data of a given stock using Python programming language. I have used the Investpy library to fetch the historical stock data of a particular stock in Bangladesh. I then used Pandas and datetime libraries to manipulate the data and create a new table by combining the fetched data. This new table consists of several columns, such as stock closing price, DSE price, stock return, DSE return, market-adjusted model, CAPM, and constant-adjusted model.

I also used statistical models like ANOVA and OLS to perform data analysis on the data. I created several CSV files to store the analyzed data at different stages of the analysis.

Skills Used:

Python programming
Data manipulation using Pandas library
Statistical analysis using ANOVA and OLS models
Data visualization using CSV files
Tools and Libraries Used:

Python 3.x
Investpy
Pandas
Datetime
